                                using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not
                                agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our services.</p>

                            <h3 class="terms-section-title">1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                            <p class="terms-text">
                                By registering for or using our platform, you agree to abide by all the terms and
                                conditions outlined in this agreement. This includes all rules, policies, guidelines,
                                and any future amendments made by the platform. If you do not agree with any of these
                                terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of the platform. Continued use of the
                                platform after any updates to these terms will constitute your acceptance of such
                                updates. It is your responsibility to regularly review these terms to stay informed
                                about any changes.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="terms-section-title">2. Eligibility</h3>
                            <p class="terms-text">
                                To be eligible to use the platform, you must be at least 18 years of age and legally
                                capable of entering into a binding contract. By using our services, you confirm that you
                                meet the eligibility requirements. During the registration process, you must provide
                                accurate, truthful, and verifiable information. Providing false or misleading
                                information can result in account suspension or termination. The platform reserves the
                                right to request further documentation to verify your identity or eligibility at any
                                time, especially for large transactions or withdrawals.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="terms-section-title">3. Deposits</h3>
                            <p class="terms-text">
                                Deposits into your account can only be made through approved payment channels, which may
                                include bank transfers, credit cards, or other online payment systems. Once a deposit is
                                made, the funds will typically reflect in your account within one hour, assuming the
                                payment is successfully processed. However, delays may occur in cases of technical
                                issues, payment gateway delays, or manual verification processes. All deposits must come
                                from accounts that are owned by you. Deposits from third-party accounts are strictly
                                prohibited and will result in the reversal of the deposit and potential suspension of
                                the account.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="terms-section-title">4. Daily Credit Allocation</h3>
                            <p class="terms-text">
                                As part of our service, users are entitled to receive a fixed daily credit allocation of
                                1% based on their active deposit balance. This allocation will be credited to your
                                account every weekday (Monday to Friday), excluding weekends and official market
                                holidays when the platform is closed for business. This daily credit is not a guaranteed
                                financial return and is subject to the platform’s internal operational model. It is
                                essential to note that the 1% allocation is part of our business strategy and not a
                                traditional financial investment or guaranteed earnings. Users must understand that the
                                credit allocation is contingent on market conditions and platform performance.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="terms-section-title">5. Withdrawals</h3>
                            <p class="terms-text">
                                Users are allowed to withdraw their funds at any time, subject to the platform’s
                                verification process and compliance checks. Withdrawal requests will typically be
                                processed within 24 hours of submission, although processing times may vary depending on
                                factors such as payment partner delays, transaction volume, or additional verification
                                requirements. Please note that some payment methods may incur processing fees, which
                                will be deducted from your withdrawal amount. Withdrawals may also be delayed during
                                periods of high transaction load or due to system maintenance. It is the user’s
                                responsibility to ensure that the withdrawal details provided are correct to avoid any
                                delays or errors.
                            </p>

                                Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account login
                                credentials, including username and password. It is recommended that you use a strong
                                password and avoid sharing your login details with anyone. If you suspect any
                                unauthorized access to your account, it is your responsibility to notify the platform
                                immediately. The platform will take reasonable steps to protect your information, but we
                                cannot be held liable for any unauthorized access due to your own negligence, including
                                weak passwords or compromised devices. It is strongly advised that you enable two-factor
                                authentication (2FA) if available, as an additional security measure.
                            </p>

                            <p class="terms-text">
                                Our platform may offer a referral program, where users can earn rewards for referring
                                new customers to the platform. The details and structure of the referral program,
                                including rewards and eligibility criteria, will be made available on the platform. The
                                company reserves the right to modify, pause, or discontinue the referral program at any
                                time without prior notice. Users must not engage in fraudulent activities, such as
                                creating fake accounts or misleading referrals to gain rewards. Any abuse of the
                                referral program may result in the suspension or termination of the user’s account and
                                forfeiture of any accumulated referral rewards.
                            </p>

                            <p class="terms-text">
                                The platform strictly prohibits any fraudulent activities, including but not limited to
                                money laundering, system manipulation, identity fraud, or creating multiple fake
                                accounts to exploit the system. Engaging in such activities can result in immediate
                                suspension or permanent termination of the user’s account. Users are also prohibited
                                from attempting to hack, bypass security features, or exploit any vulnerabilities in the
                                platform. Any illegal activity conducted on the platform will be reported to the
                                relevant authorities, and users may face legal action in addition to account suspension.
                                It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their actions on the platform comply with
                                all applicable laws and regulations.

                                The platform reserves the right to update these terms and conditions at any time, and
                                users are encouraged to review them regularly. Any major updates or changes will be
                                communicated to users through official channels, such as email or notifications on the
                                platform. In addition, the platform reserves the right to amend the daily credit
                                allocation rate, suspend or terminate user accounts that exhibit suspicious activity,
                                and refuse service to users who violate any of the platform’s guidelines. These actions
                                may be taken without prior notice in order to protect the integrity and security of the
                                platform and its users. The company also reserves the right to change or discontinue
                                services at its discretion.

                                The platform is not liable for any losses or damages resulting from technical issues,
                                system downtimes, unauthorized access due to user negligence, incorrect user inputs, or
                                any external factors beyond its control, including but not limited to internet outages,

                                allocations. Users understand that the 1% daily credit allocation is not an investment
                                return and may be adjusted or discontinued at the discretion of the platform. Users also
